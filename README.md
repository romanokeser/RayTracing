# Ray Tracing

Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to simulate the behavior of light in a virtual environment. By tracing the path of light rays as they interact with virtual objects, ray tracing enables the creation of highly realistic images with accurate lighting, shadows, reflections, and refractions.
